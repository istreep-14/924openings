Complete Chess Opening Analysis System - Google Apps Script Project
Project Overview
Build a comprehensive chess opening analysis system using Google Apps Script that leverages your premium opening database (3000+ openings with FEN, evaluations, and statistics) combined with Chess.com game data to create sophisticated performance insights and opening recommendations.
Core Data Assets
Premium Opening Database (Your Competitive Advantage)
Each of your 3000+ openings contains:

FEN Position: Exact position identifier for precise matching

Theory Classification: Book/notable importance ratings
Move Sequences: Mainline theoretical moves

Chess.com Game Data (Via API)
Each game provides:

PGN with complete move history
Time per move data
Game metadata: Result, opponent rating, time control, date
Opening URL: Chess.com's final opening classification
